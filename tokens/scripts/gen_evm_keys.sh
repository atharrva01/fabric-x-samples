# Generates the secp256k1 identities the EVM leg of the swap sample needs: one key per EVM
# endorser (bound to an existing FSC endorser identity, never reusing its Fabric MSP key) and one
# submitter key per owner node that pays its own gas. Each is a fresh, locally generated scalar,
# written as a hex file in the format x/token/services/network/evm's keystore.LoadKey expects
# (plain hex, optionally 0x-prefixed), never committed and never reused across runs.
#
# Usage: gen_evm_keys.sh <output-dir>
# Writes, under <output-dir>: endorser1.key, endorser2.key, submitter-owner1.key,
# submitter-owner2.key, and addresses.env (the derived 0x address for each, as shell assignments
# that deploy_evm.sh and the conf-evm core.yaml files consume).
